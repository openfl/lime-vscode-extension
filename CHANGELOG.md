# Change Log

1.5.1 (05/22/2025)
------------------

* Fixed infinite re-attempts to create `lime` alias when executing Lime setup command after alias creation fails.
* Fixed misleading error messages when debugging fails, but Lime is not installed.
* Improved error message when Lime is too old by mentioning the version number that is installed.
* Fixed outdated error message when trying to debug HashLink on macOS, and allow it.
* Improved location of error message when HashLink is not found by making it more prominent instead of hidden in developer logs.

1.5.1 (02/01/2024)
------------------

* Fixed "Error: Incorrect number of arguments for command 'display'" when `lime.projectFile` path contains spaces.
* Fixed incorrect request to install Lime if `haxelib config` returns a non-zero exit code because the user probably hasn't run `haxelib setup` yet. The Haxe extension will provide an appropriate error message and resolution options.
* Fixed generated `lime` command arguments when `lime.projectFile` is explicitly set to _project.xml_.
* Fixed `lime setup -alias` issue where it froze asking for input. Now passes the `-y` option.
* Fixed incorrect attempt to install Lime when `lime.executable` points to a custom command.

1.5.0 (02/02/2023)
------------------

* Added new "OpenFL: Create New Project" and "Lime: Create New Project" commands. Must be run with an empty folder.
* Improved messaging when `lime display` command fails. Does not suggest `lime setup` as frequently, since that's not always the solution. Displays the full error text in an output channel instead of devtools to make things less confusing.
* Fixed HashLink debugging for Lime 8.0.0.
* Fixed web browser launching with wrong port if HTML5 target flags includes a customized `--port` option.
* Debugging in Flash Player defaults to "Flash Debugger" extension, but may also use "Debugger for SWF" extension..
* Added support for Adobe AIR debugging if "Debugger for SWF" extension is installed.
